This is a Custom Component to integrate Warmup 
under-floor heating devices into Home Assistant. 

Warmup Plc manufacture under-floor heating (UFH) 
and control systems, 
including a range of wifi-enabled home thermostats. 
Some of these thermostats, such as the 4IE and 6IE, 
have an API. 
This software enables communication via this API, 
and allows Home Assistant to read and control the supported devices, 
using a python script to perform the integration. 
It is compatible with the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS).

Please note that Warmup Plc were not involved 
in the creation of this software, 
but we acknowledge their ownership of 
registered trademarks relating to their brand and products.
